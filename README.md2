Hi!
me Rahat Reza.. I’m still developing my full framework and I haven’t finished defining every domain yet, but that’s part of the journey — founders don’t wait to be “ready.” They build while learning.

I think like a maker, act like a founder, and learn like someone who knows the future is built by people who take action before they feel qualified.

My goals are big, my curiosity is endless, and my focus is simple:
learn fast, build smart, and create things that matter at scale.

I’m here to grow, connect with ambitious people, and eventually launch products that combine creativity, technology, and strong business strategy. If you’re building, dreaming, or shaping the future of software, I’d love to connect.
